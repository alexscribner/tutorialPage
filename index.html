        <h1> Functions </h1>
        <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something"
            invokes it (calls it). A function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
            Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. If one wants the code executed by the function, one will have to place the code in curly brackets{}.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Sample Code</h3>
        <br>
        <p>function hello() {<br>
                console.log("Hello World!");
            }</p>
    </div>
    <div class = 'div2'>
        <h1>Arrays</h1>
        <p> The array object is used to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays are usually great when one is working with lists.
            Array indexes are zero-based which means that the first element is 0, the second is 1, and so on.
        Arrays have three properties to them overall. They contain a contructor,
    length, and prototype. The constructor returns the function that created the array object's prototype. The length sets or returns the number of 
    elements in an array. Lastly, the prototype allows you to add properties and methods to an array.</p>
    <br>
        <h3>Sample Code</h3>
     <br>
        <p>let movies= ['Black Panther', 'Step Brothers', 'The Lion King'];</p>
    <br>
    </div>
    <div class = 'div3'>
        <h1>Objects</h1>
        <p>An object is defined by as a container that can hold multiple datatypes. Objects are denoted by the characters
            {}.Objects are variables too. But the objects can contain many values. Objects have keys and values (color (key): 'blue' (value) ).
             Also, each key of an object is seperated by a comma. One good comparison for objects is to think of them as cars. A car has properties like weight and color,
            and methods like start and stop. All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
            Also all cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
        </p>
            <h3>Sample Code</h3><br>
            <p>var bobAlcorn = {<br>
                name             : "Bob Alcorn",<br>
                age              : 59,<br>
                vocation        : "Chief Operating Officer",<br>
                isRetired        : false<br>
            };</p>
